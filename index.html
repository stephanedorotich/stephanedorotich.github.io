                <h1>Support, Teach, Reinforce</h1>
                <p>Our mission is to help students succeed by building on what they already know.
                    Students are encouraged to communicate their knowledge. This supports learning by allowing them
                    to try to solve problems and questions first, instead of relying on outside help. Their learning
                    is then supported by teaching and instruction to help them build accurate and effective
                    conceptual models for their topics.

                <h1>Hi, I'm St√©phane!</h1>
                <p>
                    I live in Cochrane, Alberta and have lived here most of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I study Computer Science at the University of Calgary and am interested in developing softwares that support informed decision making. I am passionate about fostering understanding, critical thinking, and empathy in myself and in others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began tutoring in 2013 and have strengthened by ability to communicate concepts, explain theories, and suggest problem solving strategies to students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much of my time is spent studying and working on projects. In my free time, I enjoy a variety of outdoor activities like backpacking, hiking, and climbing. If I'm hanging out at home I'm probably playing guitar, cooking, or playing League of Legends.
