# stephanedorotich.github.io

This website was created from scratch by St√©phane Dorotich.

It is a two-page website, the primary page advertises my tutoring business, while the second page is an iframe of a Google Form used to collect contact details of new clients.

Much of the website was built with Bootstrap, which facilitates its mobile-responsiveness and the consistency of UI elements. Other aspects (such as the parallax background) were built from scratch with CSS and a tiny bit of JS.

The website is hosted on GitHub pages, which allowed me to circumvent the need for getting my own SSL certs or setting up a webserver.
